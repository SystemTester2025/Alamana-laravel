1. THE FEWER LINES OF CODE, THE BETTER  
Proceed like a senior developer.  
3. DO NOT STOP UNTIL COMPLETE  
Do not stop working on this until you've implemented this feature fully and completely.
4. THREE REASONING PARAGRAPHS  
Start by writing three reasoning paragraphs analyzing what the error might be. Do not jump to conclusions.
5. ANSWER IN SHORT  
Answer in short.
6. DO NOT DELETE COMMENTS  
Do not delete comments.
7. SUMMARY OF CURRENT STATE  
Before we proceed, I need you to give me a summary of the current state. Summarize what we just did, which files were updated, and what didn’t work. Do not include assumptions or theories—only the facts.
8. UNBIASED 50/50  
Before you answer, I want you to write two detailed paragraphs, one for each solution. Do not jump to conclusions or commit to either solution until you have fully considered both. Then tell me which solution is obviously better and why.
9. PROPERLY FORMED SEARCH QUERY  
Your task is to write a one-paragraph search query as if you were instructing a human researcher. Clearly state what to find and request code snippets or technical details when relevant.
10. START WITH UNCERTAINTY  
You should start the reasoning paragraph with lots of uncertainty and slowly gain confidence as you think about the item more.
11. BE CAREFUL WITH RED HERRINGS  
Give me the TL;DR of the search results, but be careful. Often the search results contain dangerous and distracting red herrings.
12. ONLY INCLUDE TRULY NECESSARY STEPS  
Break this large change into the required steps. Only include the truly necessary steps.
